<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A task-tracker app is a simple prioritized list of the tasks of a person must complete. People make a list of everything they need to do, ranked according to priority from the most critical task at the top to the least critical task at the bottom.

A few features of a good task-tracker list Application includes:<br>
‚Ä¢ Add tasks and execute simple actions.<br>
‚Ä¢ Prioritize, manage, and reason about tasks.<br>
‚Ä¢ Record notes, action items and ideas.<br>

Task-tracker includes tasks or atomic entities that make up a to-do list. To-dos are made quickly, the bulk of them do not specify the work; instead, they are typically just comprehensive enough to serve as a valuable indicator. To be sure, to-do terminology like "Groceries" or "Car Wash" is frequently grammatically correct. Because the signal is so quick, it is only useful for a short period of time while the task is remembered. In certain cases, a simple item like a stack is enough to recall the job without the need for a note.
